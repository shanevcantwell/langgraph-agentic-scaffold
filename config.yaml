# SpecialistHub Configuration Example
# Version: 3.0
#
# ==============================================================================
# DEVELOPER-LEVEL CONFIGURATION
# This file is the system's blueprint, intended for developers to define the
# agent's architecture. It should NOT be exposed to or editable by end-users.
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file defines the structure of the agentic system. It is the single
# source of truth for wiring together providers, models, and specialists.
# Copy this file to `config.yaml` and customize it for your setup.

# ==============================================================================
# LLM PROVIDER CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Define the available LLM providers. The keys here (e.g., 'lmstudio') are
# referenced by the specialists below.
# The application will read environment variables defined in .env for secrets.
#
# Supported providers: "lmstudio", "ollama", "gemini"
# ==============================================================================
llm_providers:
  # A configuration for a local model via LM Studio
  local_lmstudio:
    # Uses the LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL from your .env file
    # Example: LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
    type: "lmstudio"
    api_identifier: "openai-oss-22b" # The exact model identifier for the server

  # A configuration for a local model via Ollama
  local_ollama:
    # Uses OLLAMA_BASE_URL and OLLAMA_MODEL from your .env file
    # Example: OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
    type: "ollama"
    api_identifier: "gemma3:27b" # The model name registered with Ollama

  # A configuration for a powerful, general-purpose Gemini model
  gemini_pro:
    # Uses GEMINI_API_KEY from your .env file
    type: "gemini"
    api_identifier: "gemini-2.5-pro"
    # Future parameters could go here, e.g., temperature: 0.5

  # A configuration for a fast, cheaper Gemini model
  gemini_flash:
    # Uses GEMINI_API_KEY from your .env file
    type: "gemini"
    api_identifier: "gemini-2.5-flash"

# ==============================================================================
# WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Define the entry point for the graph. Defaults to 'router_specialist'.
# ==============================================================================
workflow:
  entry_point: "prompt_triage_specialist"

# ==============================================================================
# SPECIALIST CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Define each specialist agent. The key for each specialist (e.g., 'router_specialist')
# must match the specialist's Python module name (router_specialist.py) and the
# name passed to super().__init__() in its constructor.
# ==============================================================================
