## üìù System Plan

_Enhance the 1970s wood and brushed aluminum themed web page by refining typography and color palette, adding dynamic animations for background and element entry, implementing advanced visual feedback for checklist interactions (e.g., strike-through and highlight on check), and restructuring the layout with distinct panels and a prominent security warning, to be reviewed in one more refinement cycle._


**Execution Steps:**
1. Refine HTML Structure: Introduce more `div` elements to create distinct, '70s-style content panels (e.g., for header, main content, checklist, and security warning). Add a `div` specifically for the 'Security Warning,' separate from the main checklist content. Ensure each checklist item (`li`) contains both the `input[type="checkbox"]` and its `label` for easier CSS targeting.
2. Enhance '70s Theming (CSS): Update body/main container background with a more detailed or varied wood texture. Apply a subtle `linear-gradient` for brushed aluminum effects to panel borders and accents. Import Google Fonts (e.g., 'VT323' for display, 'IBM Plex Mono' for code/tech, or a chunky sans-serif like 'Oswald') and apply them to titles, headings, and body text to better evoke the era. Introduce `var()` CSS variables for 1970s earthy tones (e.g., avocado green, burnt orange, mustard yellow, various browns) and apply them for accents, text, and specific panel backgrounds. Add subtle pseudo-elements to the body or main content wrapper for a soft CRT-like scanline effect and a gentle vignette using CSS gradients.
3. Implement Dynamic Animations (CSS): Create a subtle, slow-panning or pulsing `background-position` animation on the main body background to add a sense of movement. Use `@keyframes` to animate key panels or content sections (e.g., the title, main content area, checklist) sliding in or fading in with a slight delay upon page load, mimicking early computer screen displays. Refine hover effects for interactive elements (buttons, links) to have a more distinct, '70s-tech feel (e.g., less smooth transitions, bolder color changes).
4. Advance Checklist Interactivity and Styling (CSS): Style the actual `input[type="checkbox"]` to appear more retro, possibly with a custom square design and a distinct checkmark. When a checkbox is checked, apply `text-decoration: line-through` to its corresponding `label`. Also, change the background color or add a subtle `box-shadow` to the entire `li` or `label` element to visually highlight its completion. Ensure smooth `transition` effects for these changes.
5. Refine Layout and Content Presentation (CSS): Reorganize the layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox to create clearly defined, bordered panels for different sections (e.g., a header panel, an instruction panel, a checklist panel, a warning panel). These panels should have '70s-style borders (e.g., with brushed aluminum accents). Apply a distinct, eye-catching style to the 'Security Warning' panel using a bold font, a '70s warning color (e.g., deep orange or red-brown), and a prominent border to make it stand out. Remove default list bullets and instead use custom styling for `li` elements, potentially with a '70s-style icon or custom numbering.

  "summary": "The `langgraph-agentic-scaffold` is an Open Core, MIT-licensed foundational project for building robust, modular, and scalable multi-agent systems using LangGraph. It provides a production-ready, API-driven architecture based on a separation of concerns: 'Specialists' for specific tasks and 'Orchestrators' for managing workflows. Key features include an API-first design (FastAPI), configuration-driven setup, decoupled LLM adapters, schema-enforced reliability with Pydantic, and modern Python tooling. The project emphasizes a critical security warning, advising users to run it in sandboxed environments due to the LLM's potential for significant control over system resources. Installation involves OS-specific scripts, environment setup, and then starting the API server and interacting via a CLI.",
